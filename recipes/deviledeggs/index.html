        <p><strong>Deviled eggs</strong> are eggs that have been deviled. What that means we don’t know, but it doesn’t matter.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Eggs.</li>
                <li>Fire. If you can’t personally ask the devil to devil your eggs, fire will suffice.</li>
                <li>Mustard</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Hard Boil your eggs. This means boil them until they are hard.</li>
                <li>Ask the devil to devil your eggs. If he refuses or if you are unable to reach him on account of there being a fire extinguisher on the premises, you could die and go ask him or you could simply light yourself on fire and wave a trident around. Then you would be able to devil the eggs. Proceed to do so.</li>
                <li>Add mustard. How you do it it doesn’t matter, but just add mustard.</li>
                <li>Enjoy.</li>
            </ol>
